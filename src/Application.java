/**
 * Project made by Gustavo Eugênio to attend Axur's Engineering Intern Test and adapted to Hackoon Space submissal.
 * Personal GitHub -> github.com/Gustavoesm.
 * <p>
 * This project should detect blacklisted words in the webpage stream given the correct url.
 * It should also detect "disguised words", that replaces common latin letters for their respective Homoglyphs.
 * To have access to more information about or include further Homoglyphs, check src/impl/Homoglyphs.java.java.
 * To update the blacklisted words list, check challenge/BlacklistedWords.java.
 * <p>
 * The main class receives the page's URL as it's single argument, and returns any matches with "match" or "no match".
